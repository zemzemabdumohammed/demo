<h1>Like A Rolling Stone</h1>
<h2>Bob Dylan</h2>
<p>People call say 'beware doll, you're bound to fall'
You thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about </p>
    <p>How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone</p>
<p> On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you</p>
<p> How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone</p>
